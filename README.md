# Gneiss::core
The Core Module. All Gneiss modules depend upon it.

You *will* need other files to run a minimum Gneiss M-MVC frame. See the examples (soon to be listed) for more.

Gneiss::core expects to be located in ./modules/

Note: All Gneiss modules use a namespace that reflects the folder structure. This both enables the autoloader to work and keeps filenames non-dependant on other modules.
